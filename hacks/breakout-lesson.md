## **OOP BREAKOUT LESSON** âœ¨

---

## **Setup**

You should be able to access a forked copy of the pages repository under Open Coding Society. This is where you will be able to access the game and make local edits. If you would like to commit your changes, copy the file to a personal repository before continuing.

After having opened VSCode, run:
```js
make
```
...and navigate to the OOP Breakout game in hacks. You should be able to see the traditional version of Breakout.

Brainstorm some ideas of changes you can make. Here are some "How might we..." questions to help you get started:
- How might we change the color of the ball, paddle, or blocks?
- How might we alter the speed of the game?
- How might we make the game display more to the user in a neater fashion?
